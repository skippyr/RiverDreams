# River Dreams

A fast prompt for ZSH with its own modules written using C and implemented
using shell scripting.

This branch contains the source code, yet under development, but some code
already can be tested.

## Dependencies

  + `gcc` and C standart libraries: this will be probably installed in your
    system already.
  + `libgit2`: this library usually comes bundled with `git`. That application
    will also be used in the `Installation` section.

## Installation

  + First install the dependencies from the `Dependencies` section.
  + Clone this repository.
  + Add a source rule in your `~/.zshrc` to the file `river_dreams.zsh-theme`
    that is in the root directory of this repository.
  + Restart your ZSH section and wait for the modules source codes be recompiled
    automatically.
  + Enjoy your new prompt.
