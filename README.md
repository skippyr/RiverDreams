<h1>River Dreams</h1>
	<h2>Starting Point</h2>
		<p>A tribal inspired theme for the ZSH shell that includes a fallback text feature.</p>
		<p>When dealing with shells, a theme for it means the prompt that you see when typing commands and not necessary the colors.</p>
		<p>River Dreams takes minimal aesthetics and features into account to bring you a graceful experience when using a terminal emulator.</p>
		<p>In the preview, below, you can see a demo of River Dreams with its default look.</p>

		<p>For those moments where you can not have access to a rich terminal and have to use bitmap fonts, River Dreams will still be there with you: it includes a fallback text feature that is automatically activated based in your terminal emulator's color support. Or you can manually activate it too.</p>
