<h1>River Dreams</h1>
	<h2>Starting Point</h2>
		<p>A tribal inspired theme for the ZSH shell that includes a fallback text feature.</p>
		<p>When dealing with shells, a theme for it means the prompt that you see when typing commands and not necessary the colors.</p>
		<p>River Dreams takes minimal aesthetics and features into account to bring you a graceful experience when using a terminal emulator.</p>
		<p>In the preview, below, you can see a demo of River Dreams with its default look.</p>

		<p>For those moments where you can not have access to a rich terminal and have to use bitmap fonts, River Dreams will still be there with you: it includes a fallback text feature that is automatically activated based in your terminal emulator's color support. Or you can manually activate it too.</p>

	<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
		<p>River Dreams is heavily inspired by tribal patterns, which you will see throughout the whole set of symbols I have chosen for it.</p>
		<p>It is also inspired in the look of other popular ZSH themes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>robbyrussel</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">OhMyZSH</a> framework.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerlevel10k</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt">Spaceship Prompt</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So, you will probably find some similarities with those themes too.</p>
