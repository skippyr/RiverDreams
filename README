River Dreams
============

A fast and simple prompt for the ZSH shell with a tribal design.

Requirements
------------

In order to build it, you will simply need a C compiler, like GCC, and be
running an UNIX operating system.

Installation
------------

- Compile the file `riverdreams.c`.

```c
gcc riverdreams.c -o riverdreams
```

- Make its output be your ZSH prompt by editing your `~/.zshrc` file. Replace
  `<DIR>` by the path for its repository.

```c
setopt promptsubst
PROMPT=$(<DIR>/riverdreams)
```

- Reopen ZSH.
